Behringer support in the Midi2Cat project, source code modifications summary
Chris Codella, W2PA
3 May 2017 

Compiled and tested on openPowerSDR v3.3.16 forked from W5WC's GitHub repository.  This version temporarily adds "M2" to the program name, indicating it's the second version of Midi2Cat.

All changes to the code are flagged by comment lines beginning with //-W2PA
The only exceptions are the two instances noted below in which the Designer view caused updates/changes to the automatically generated code.

Most modifications were to the Midi2Cat project.  Diff confirms there were no changes to this package since 3.3.9.

In the PowerSDR project, the following changes were made to three files:

Midi2CatCommands.cs
Extensive changes to allow interaction with the Behringer controllers.  These changes match up with and make use of changes made in the Midi2Cat project itself.

Console.cs
1) Code was added to some of the pdbXXX_scroll handler functions to allow the UI to send messages back to the Behringer conrtoller to light its LEDs according to the current setting.  So when you turn a mini-wheel (knob) on the Behringer PL-1, the LEDs light around its range.  And when you slide a slider in the UI that a mini-wheel has been mapped to, the LEDs also change accordingly.
2) Added a check box to synchronize RIT/XIT.  This is how most rigs operate. But it's a choice now with this check box.  This is one instance in which the Designer view caused updates/changes to the automatically generated code - the handlers for the new check box "chkSyncIT."
3) Changed the power level that trips SWR protection in Tune mode from 10W to 35W to allow for amplifiers with auto-tuners that don't kick in until around 30W of drive.  Feel free to remove this change.  I can make it a choice in Setup in a later version.  This is one instance in which the Designer view caused updates/changes to the automatically generated code - the label for the checkbox in Setup changed.

CATCommands.cs
1) The RIT increment was made 10Hz regardless of mode.  Originally it changed.
